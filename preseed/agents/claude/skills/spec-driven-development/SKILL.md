# Spec-Driven Development

A product specification (`sdd/`) is the single source of truth for **what the product does and why**. It is not a record of what the code currently does. It is not a bug tracker. It is not a changelog of every commit.

The full enforcement layer lives in the `spec-discipline` rule (loaded automatically). This skill describes the workflow on top of those rules.

## How it works at a glance

The user runs `/sdd init` once to bootstrap. After that, they "vibe code" — write code, push, walk away. The `spec-reviewer` and `doc-updater` agents auto-detect the `sdd/` folder and enforce discipline on every PR-boundary event, in the mode set by `sdd/config.yml` (`interactive`, `auto`, or `unleashed`).

The user only invokes `/sdd` directly to:
- Bootstrap a new project (`/sdd init` → invokes the `sdd-init` skill)
- Manually add or modify requirements (`/sdd edit`, `/sdd add` — body below)
- Rescue a rotted spec (`/sdd clean` → invokes the `sdd-clean` skill)
- Switch autonomy mode (`/sdd mode` — body below)

## Sub-commands

| Command | Skill / body |
|---|---|
| `/sdd` | Help screen (the `/sdd` command file) |
| `/sdd init [idea]` | Invoke the `sdd-init` skill (greenfield, import, resume) |
| `/sdd edit {domain}` | This skill, § /sdd edit |
| `/sdd add {domain}` | This skill, § /sdd add |
| `/sdd clean` | Invoke the `sdd-clean` skill (mode-aware spec rescue) |
| `/sdd mode {interactive\|auto\|unleashed}` | This skill, § /sdd mode |

```

**Dual-layout support during migration window.** Skills detect layout via `test -d sdd/spec`. Projects on flat layout (`sdd/{domain}.md` directly) keep working; `/sdd clean` migrates flat → nested on demand. The flat layout will be deprecated after one release cycle; no new flat-layout projects should be created.

**Layout is exhaustive (binding).** The tree above is the COMPLETE allowed set of files under `sdd/` and `documentation/` on the nested layout. Anything else is a violation:
- No `sdd/spec/README.md` — the single comprehensive index is `sdd/README.md` (Vision + Actors + Design Principles + Domains table linking to `spec/{file}.md` + Out of Scope, plus one-line links to constraints/glossary/documentation/changelog).
- No `documentation/lanes/README.md` — the lane index is `documentation/README.md` (Jump-TOC + Lane ownership + REQ backlinks + Synonym glossary + Reading order + Related).
- No extra subdirectories under `sdd/spec/`, `documentation/lanes/`, or `documentation/decisions/`.

The enforcement check (one walk, one rule) lives in `doc-enforce-lanes` § Layout conformance.

**Dotfile reduction.** The nested schema consolidates four prior dotfiles (`.review-needed.md`, `.coverage-report.md`, `.last-clean-run.md`, `.review-decisions.md`) into one `.review-queue.md`. `/sdd clean` audit lives in commit history (`git log --grep='\[sdd-clean\]'` + commit bodies). `/review` cross-run dedup, when needed, is derived from `git log --grep='\[review\]'`.

## REQ format

**Canonical shape: see `references/templates/req-shape-example.md`.** That file is the single source of truth — a fully-rendered two-REQ example with every field, blank lines, numbered ACs, source-anchor comments, and the empty-field (`None.`) rendering. Every Active REQ in `sdd/{domain}.md` (or `sdd/spec/{domain}.md` on the nested layout) MUST copy that shape verbatim. Deviations are MEDIUM, auto-fixed by re-rendering (mechanics in `spec-enforce` § REQ rendering template).

**Hard rules (scannable mid-write — the full exemplar is in the template):**

- Heading is `### REQ-{DOMAIN}-{NNN}: {Title}` (H3, never H2).
- Field order is locked: **Intent → Applies To → Acceptance Criteria → Notes (optional) → Constraints → Priority → Dependencies → Verification → Status**. Status is the LAST field, never the first.
- **Required fields** (every REQ): Intent, Applies To, Acceptance Criteria, Constraints, Priority, Dependencies, Verification, Status. Constraints and Dependencies render the literal `None.` when empty; omitting them entirely is MEDIUM `req-missing-required-field`.
- One blank line between every `**Field:**` line. Stacking two label lines on consecutive lines collapses them on GitHub render — MEDIUM `trailing-fields-collapsed`.
- ACs are **numbered** (`1. 2. 3.`), never bulleted (`-`) — MEDIUM `ac-bullets-not-numbered`. Maximum 7 ACs per REQ.
- CON-* and REQ-* IDs inside Constraints/Dependencies render as markdown anchor links, not plain text — MEDIUM `cross-reference-not-linked`.
- Every AC describing observable behaviour ends with `<!-- @impl: <path>::<symbol> -->`. ACs asserting a concrete value use `<!-- @impl: <path>::<symbol> = <value-pattern> -->`. Validators in `spec-enforce-truth` (CQ-SOURCE) read these comments and verify symbol + value against source. AC bullets without an anchor are valid but generate `ac-missing-source-anchor` findings (MEDIUM); `Verification: Manual check` REQs are exempt. Same convention applies to ADR `Context:` blocks.
- **Notes** is OPTIONAL — only two shapes (see `spec-enforce` § Rule B): Partial-explanation (`Status: Partial` only, ≤3 sentences) or Doc-pointer (any status, ≤2 sentences, MUST contain a markdown link to `documentation/**` or `sdd/**`). Sibling-REQ cross-references go in `Dependencies:`.
- Each REQ ends with `---` on its own line, blank lines either side.
- **Deprecated REQs are deleted, not tombstoned.** No `Replaced By:`, no `Removed In:`. Out-of-scope ideas go to `## Out of Scope` in the domain README.

## Source-anchor convention (binding, single source of truth)

The `@impl` HTML comment is the framework's anchor format for the Truth guarantee.

**Form:**

```
<!-- @impl: <path>::<symbol> -->
<!-- @impl: <path>::<symbol> = <value-pattern> -->
```

- `<path>` is a repo-relative file path (forward slashes regardless of host OS).
- `<symbol>` is the function, class, constant, route, or other named site that implements the AC. Multi-segment symbols use `.` (e.g., `ClassName.methodName`).
- `<value-pattern>` (optional) is the literal value the AC asserts (e.g., `50`, `"oauth-callback"`, `30 * 60`). For non-trivial patterns use a substring the validator can grep.

**Examples:**

```
<!-- @impl: lib/services/auth_service.dart::login -->
<!-- @impl: lib/services/activity_service.dart::_maxActivities = 50 -->
<!-- @impl: cloudflare-oauth-redirect/src/worker.js::handleCallback -->
<!-- @impl: src/middleware/admin-auth.ts::adminGate -->
```

**Detection regex:** `<!--\s*@impl:\s*([^:]+)::([^\s=]+)(?:\s*=\s*(.+?))?\s*-->`

**Validation contract (CQ-SOURCE in `spec-enforce-truth`, Pass 15 in `doc-enforce-truth`):**

1. Resolve `<symbol>` via `mcp__graphify__get_node` against the unified graph. Fallback: grep `<symbol>` in `<path>` when graphify cannot resolve.
2. Symbol not resolved → HIGH `spec-anchor-orphaned` (or `doc-anchor-orphaned`).
3. If `<value-pattern>` present: grep symbol body for literal pattern. Not found → HIGH `spec-value-drift` (or `doc-value-drift`).
4. If `<value-pattern>` absent: confirm symbol body contains ≥3 AC-token overlap. Not found → MEDIUM `spec-behavior-orphaned`.

**Drift behaviour:** symbol renames or deletions break the anchor and force a spec update on the next PR-boundary review — correct, because renames change the contract. Line moves within a file do NOT break the anchor (graphify indexes by symbol identity, not line number).

**This validation runs ALWAYS** — both `enforce_tdd: true` and `enforce_tdd: false`, both Greenfield and Import Mode, both inside and outside SDD transition. `enforce_tdd` gates only the test-anchor check (`Implemented` defaulting on test absence); it never gates source-anchor truth-check.

## Status semantics

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Proposed` | Being drafted, not yet committed to spec |
| `Planned` | Committed to spec, not yet built |
| `Partial` | Built but some AC unmet OR no automated test verification found |
| `Implemented` | Built AND tests verify the acceptance criteria |

**One word, no prose.** No commit SHAs, no file paths, no "Partial — missing X, Y, Z". Use the optional `Notes:` field (≤3 sentences) for Partial only. Use `pending.md` for implementation tracking.

**Default Status when source exists but no test references the REQ ID:**
- `enforce_tdd: true` → `Partial`.
- `enforce_tdd: false` → `Implemented` (opted out of test-based verification; demoting every REQ would falsely brand the spec incomplete). Each `sdd/{domain}.md` file (per domain, not `sdd/README.md`) appends `_Verification: code-only (no automated coverage)._` at the bottom when this branch fires.

**Removed and never-built REQs.** When a REQ stops being the contract — feature removed, replaced, scope dropped — delete it from `sdd/{domain}.md`. Do not tombstone with `Status: Deprecated`. Never-built ideas go to `## Out of Scope`.

## Three autonomy modes

| Behavior | interactive | auto | unleashed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Where work lands | Current branch | Current branch | Current branch |
| SAFE fixes (strip strikethrough, truncate prose Status, generate backlinks, move forbidden content) | Confirm → apply | Apply silently | Apply silently |
| RISKY fixes (truncate changes.md, mass moves, bulk operations) | Confirm + backup + apply | Backup + apply | Backup + apply |
| JUDGMENT calls (doc-vs-spec conflict, oversized REQ, fake-Deprecated) | Escalate to user, pause | Escalate to layout-resolved triage file (`sdd/spec/.review-queue.md` nested OR `sdd/.review-needed.md` flat legacy), continue | Auto-resolve conservatively, continue |
| `enforce_tdd` default | per layout-resolved config (`sdd/spec/config.yml` nested OR `sdd/config.yml` flat; default true) | same | **Forced true** |
| Output | Inline confirmations | Inline reports | Inline reports; per-category commits |

The fundamental difference is **how JUDGMENT is handled**. All modes push to the current branch. No PR, no new branch, no artificial change limits.

Conservative JUDGMENT auto-resolution rules live in the `sdd-clean` skill (that's where they apply).

## Auto-detection — when SDD enforcement runs without /sdd

Once `sdd/` exists, the workflow runs automatically:

- At PR-boundary events for PRs targeting `main` or `master` (PR open OR push to a branch with such a PR open): `code-reviewer`, `spec-reviewer`, and `doc-updater` all run **in parallel** — they are report-only (findings go to a triage file; the main session applies fixes), so there is no shared-write race or ordering dependency.
- Both `sdd/`-lane agents detect `sdd/` exists → SDD-strict mode.
- **Layout detection:** `test -d sdd/spec` → nested (canonical); else flat (legacy, in migration window). Skills' file globs branch on this detection. `sdd/config.yml` lives at `sdd/spec/config.yml` (nested) or `sdd/config.yml` (flat).
- Both agents read `config.yml` → know whether to be interactive/auto/unleashed.
- Findings are auto-fixed per mode.

If `sdd/` doesn't exist, `spec-reviewer` exits silently. `doc-updater` runs in `docs-only` mode.

**SDLC requirements for autonomous review:** the pipeline gates on PR base = `main` or `master`. PRs into intermediate integration branches (`develop`, `staging`) are deferred until the integration branch's PR-to-`main` opens or syncs. Trunk-based projects using a different default branch name get no review (v1 hardcoded gate). `gh` CLI must be installed + authenticated. Upstream tracking on the working branch must resolve (`git rev-parse @{u}`). Strongly recommended: GitHub branch protection on `main` requiring PR before merge.

The hooks fail-safe in the right direction: if `gh` is missing or transiently fails, the Stop hook errs toward enforcement; the PostToolUse directive errs toward emission. Either way, the user can invoke review agents manually via the Task tool.

## /sdd edit — adding or modifying requirements

Always interactive. The agent:
1. Reads `sdd/README.md`, `sdd/constraints.md`, `sdd/glossary.md`, and the target domain file.
2. Asks the user what they want to add or change.
3. Drafts new/modified REQs in proper format.
4. Validates against discipline rules (forbidden content, length, AC quality).
5. Confirms with user.
6. Writes the updated domain file.
7. Updates glossary if new terms were introduced.
8. Adds a changelog entry to `sdd/changes.md`.

User-authored content gets one full pass before LOW-severity cleanup applies. Agent never blocks user input on style grounds.

**Post-edit hard gate:** if the new/modified REQ is `Planned` or `Partial`, next action MUST be entering Plan Mode (see § Plan Mode integration).

## /sdd add — creating a new domain

Same as `/sdd edit` but creates a new domain file:
1. Asks the user what the domain covers.
2. Proposes 5-15 initial requirements.
3. Creates `sdd/{domain}.md`.
4. Updates the domain index in `sdd/README.md`.
5. Updates glossary and changelog.

**Post-add hard gate:** enter Plan Mode before any source/test/config edits.

## /sdd mode — switching autonomy

```bash
/sdd mode interactive   # default; agent asks before every fix
/sdd mode auto          # agent silently applies safe fixes
/sdd mode unleashed     # agent does everything without asking
/sdd mode               # show current mode
```

The setting is persistent in `sdd/config.yml` and travels with the project. Per-command overrides via `--interactive`, `--auto`, `--unleashed` flags on `/sdd clean`.

**Transition gate on `unleashed`:** `/sdd mode unleashed` is rejected while `sdd/config.yml` carries `transition: true` (open triage items). Unleashed runs blind and auto-resolves JUDGMENT; triage items need user judgment by construction. Drain the queue via Resume Mode first. `auto` and `interactive` are both allowed during transition.

## Test discipline

Every REQ marked `Status: Implemented` should have at least one test file that references its REQ ID. Test discovery uses `test_globs` from `sdd/config.yml`. Detection is binary: the REQ ID literally appears in a test (in a test name, comment, or assertion message).

**Why REQ IDs in test files:** lets `spec-reviewer` verify which Implemented REQs have automated coverage without ambiguous prose matching.

```typescript
test('REQ-AUTH-001: rejects expired JWT tokens', () => {
  // ...
});
```

When `enforce_tdd: true` (default), REQs without test references get downgraded to `Partial` with `Notes:`, and REQs whose source exists but lacks tests get flagged + auto-promoted `Planned → Partial`. Projects that genuinely cannot admit automated testing (pure visual design systems) opt out with `enforce_tdd: false`.

**Bug fix discipline:** write a failing test that reproduces the bug BEFORE writing the fix. The `tdd-guide` agent enforces this.

## TDD coverage targets

Recommended defaults, configurable per project:

| Layer | Target |
|---|---|
| Pure functions / utilities | 100% |
| API routes / handlers | 100% |
| Component rendering | 80% |
| Page-level integration | 80% |
| Default | 70% |

Guidance, not enforcement. The auto-demote rule is the only hard enforcement (binary: test exists per REQ or it doesn't).

## Plan Mode integration

**Plan Mode is mandatory on every spec→code transition:** after `/sdd init`, `/sdd edit` (if new REQ is `Planned`/`Partial`), or `/sdd add`. Next action MUST be `EnterPlanMode`. Hard gate. "build now" / "go" / "execute" / "ship it" authorize *starting*, never skipping.

The plan must:
1. Read all of `sdd/`, enumerate REQs by Status.
2. Filter to `Status: Planned` and `Status: Partial`.
3. Topo-sort by `Dependencies:`.
4. **Phase RED**: one failing test per AC via `tdd-guide`. Test name: `REQ-{DOMAIN}-{NNN}: {AC summary}`.
5. **Phase GREEN**: minimal impl, one REQ at a time, in dependency order.
6. **Phase VERIFY**: push, let `spec-reviewer` promote `Planned`→`Implemented` on next run.
7. Name the test framework from the stack (vitest, jest, pytest, go test, rspec, xctest, etc.); add Phase 0 if none exists.

**Informal proposal ≠ formal Plan Mode.** A detailed prose proposal + user "execute" / "go" / "fine" is *informal* approval. Still enter Plan Mode and re-present the same plan as a formal artifact.

**Legitimate skip:** only if the user, after seeing a plan proposal, explicitly says "skip plan mode" or "no plan". Record in feedback memory. Mark affected REQs `Partial` until tests exist.

## What is NOT a requirement

- **Bugs** → GitHub issues. The spec describes target state; bugs are the delta.
- **TODOs / known gaps** → `pending.md`. Status: Partial flags incompleteness; prose detail there.
- **Spec churn / "we tried X then Y"** → git history. No strikethrough or "Superseded:" annotations.
- **Build environment quirks** → `documentation/[lanes/]troubleshooting.md` (flat or nested layout).
- **Out-of-scope ideas** → `## Out of Scope` section in the relevant README.

## Templates location

All scaffolding templates live in `references/templates/` within this skill. The `sdd-init` skill reads them on demand. Bundled with the skill — no external dependencies.

| Template | Used by |
|---|---|
| `req-shape-example.md` | Read-only exemplar — canonical shape every REQ MUST copy. NOT emitted as a file; consulted before every REQ write. |
| `root-readme.md` | `/sdd init` → `README.md` |
| `sdd-readme.md` | `/sdd init` → `sdd/README.md` |
| `sdd-glossary.md` | `/sdd init` → `sdd/spec/glossary.md` |
| `sdd-constraints.md` | `/sdd init` → `sdd/spec/constraints.md` |
| `sdd-changes.md` | `/sdd init` → `sdd/spec/changes.md` |
| `sdd-config.yml` | `/sdd init` → `sdd/spec/config.yml` |
| `documentation-readme.md` | `/sdd init` → `documentation/README.md` |
| `documentation-architecture.md` | `/sdd init` → `documentation/lanes/architecture.md` (universal lane) |
| `documentation-api-reference.md` | `/sdd init` → `documentation/lanes/api-reference.md` (when source has HTTP routes) |
| `documentation-configuration.md` | `/sdd init` → `documentation/lanes/configuration.md` (when source has env vars / config) |
| `documentation-deployment.md` | `/sdd init` → `documentation/lanes/deployment.md` (when project is deployable) |
| `documentation-decisions-readme.md` | `/sdd init` → `documentation/decisions/README.md` |

Placeholders use `{PLACEHOLDER_NAME}` format. The agent substitutes them based on the user's input and inferred context.

## Template conventions

Templates follow `documentation-discipline.md` from the first commit. Conventions baked in:

- **One-line table cells.** Every cell stays on a single line; the 50-word per-cell budget enforced by `doc-updater` Pass 1 begins at scaffolding. If a row needs more than ~50 words, write the long form as a body paragraph below the table and replace the cell with a one-line summary + link.
- **Embedded doc-discipline directive comments.** Each template starts with `<!-- doc-discipline: <budget> lines, one-line table cells, no implementation prose -->`.
- **Per-file budgets** match `documentation-discipline.md`: architecture.md ≤350 lines, api-reference.md ≤600, configuration.md ≤200, deployment.md ≤200.
- **REQ backlinks pre-wired** in `Implements` columns: scaffolded with the exact `[REQ-X-N](../sdd/{domain}.md#req-x-n)` form.
- **Lane-correct content placeholders.** `architecture.md` template never has an "API endpoints" section (that's `api-reference.md`'s lane).
- **ADR template carries the "What is NOT an ADR" guardrail.** `documentation-decisions-readme.md` opens with the four-shape table (SAST false positive / naming-compat / risk acceptance with no alternative / implementation note framed as a decision). The AD1 example includes `Alternatives considered:` and `Consequences:` — both load-bearing.
